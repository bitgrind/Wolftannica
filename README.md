# Math App
This app was built to be a tool for math and algorithms. To be able to enter an equation into an field and get a step by step on how to solve an equation or simplify it.

## API Keys
WOLFRAM_KEY = "9QLYGR-UV2EUVQ8XK"

## Further Exploration
I would like to build out maybe a visual map of different basic equations, maybe have a input output of that equation. Enter a variable and see how it would change the equation.
